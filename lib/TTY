###active record is a object relational mapper,
###meaning, it's a connecting translating adapter for ruby to sql
in order to make databases with rows and those rows into instance variables for the class they are inherit
allows us to abstract powerful methods
don't have to write accessors, methods, and initializers for instances so that class's can access them
by allowing the active record gem write them for us
interpreter between sql database language and the ruby language
writes methods for database rows via Ruby objects
Link a Student "model" to the database table students
Ruby understands objects. The database understands raw data.
associations b/w models and their analogous database tables without having to write tons of code.
via migration files
join model combines tables
macros method that writes code for us (think metaprogramming).
tell the review class that it will produce objects that can belong to an user
user.new(name: "eric")
implemented in our classes allow us to associate a song object directly to an artist object:
writes the methods
so that we can do crud


practice the labs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 



###eric = User.First

###eric.reviews

###eric.doctors

connects our Ruby program to our database
